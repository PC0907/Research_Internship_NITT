There EX O

two CD O

reasons NNS O
why WRB O
Triada NNP B-Malware

why WRB O
it PRP O
had VBD O
impressed VBN O
our PRP$ O

so RB O
much RB O
. . O

First RB O
, , O
it PRP O
modifies VBZ O
the DT O
Zygote NNP B-System

Zygote NNP B-System
is VBZ O
the DT O
core NN O
process NN O
in IN O
the DT O
Android NNP B-System

that WDT O
is VBZ O
used VBN O
as IN O
a DT O

for IN O
every DT O

which WDT O
means VBZ O
that IN O
once RB O
the DT O
Trojan NNP O
gets VBZ O
into IN O
Zygote NNP B-System
, , O
it PRP O
becomes VBZ O
a DT O
part NN O
of IN O
literally RB O
every DT O

that WDT O

launched VBN O
on IN O
the DT O

Triada NN B-Malware

Second NNP O
, , O
it PRP O

from IN O
the DT O

of IN O
the DT O

So RB O
the DT O
system NN O
doesn JJ O
’ NNP O

see VBP O
any DT O

thus RB O

Those DT O

not RB O

only JJ O

Triada NNP B-Malware

As IN O
our PRP$ O

it PRP O
also RB O

the DT O

That DT O
is VBZ O
actually RB O
how WRB O
the DT O

Some DT O

the DT O

data NNS O
is VBZ O
transferred VBN O
via IN O
a DT O

The DT O
main JJ O
reason NN O
for IN O
developers NNS O
to TO O
choose VB O
SMS NNP O
over IN O
traditional JJ O

via IN O
Internet NNP O
is VBZ O
that IN O
in IN O
the DT O

with IN O

. . O

Users NNS O
do VBP O
not RB O

because IN O
they PRP O
are VBP O

not RB O
by IN O
the DT O

but CC O
by IN O
the DT O

that WDT O
has VBZ O
initiated VBN O
the DT O

— NNP O
e.g VBZ O
a DT O
free-to-play JJ O

Triada NNP B-Malware
’ NNP O

functionality NN O
allows VBZ O
it PRP O

so IN O
the DT O

sent VBN O
not RB O

some DT O

, , O
but CC O
to TO O
the DT O

Triada NNP B-Malware
steals VBZ O
the DT O

either CC O
